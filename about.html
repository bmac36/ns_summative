		  <h2>The Obstacles They Face</h2>
		  <ul>
			  <li>750,000 to 1,200,000 people speak Mayan, but three times that number come from Maya origina and are not capable to speak their native language.</li>
			  <li>Even with the large population that speaks Mayan, no bilingual or intercultural education exists past elementary school.</li>
			  <li>Because of the language barrier, many students that do get an education struggle to understand and require additional tutoring.</li>
			  <li>83.4% of the Mayans 15+ will drop out before finishing junior year and only only 6.6% of Mayan people obtain education past that point.</li>
			  <li>In Yucatan alone there are only 256 elementary schools, 330 kindergarten, 98 preschools, and 50 boarding schools in 2006/07.</li>
			  <li>Out of the elementary schools, more than 33% closed down and 52 of the kindergarten schools closed down depsite them being a mandatory action children must go through.</li>
			  <li>In Maxcanu district, there are 3,325 kindergarden students &mdash; but only 283 students can proceed to primary schools.</li>
			  <li>There are not enough teachers trained to teach the Mayan curriculum.</li>
			  <li>Only 57% of teachers for indigenous primary education in Yucatan reached higher education themselves.</li>
			  <li>Only 37% of teachers have reached a bachelors degree.</li>
			  <li>There are many serious effects caused by the education policy failures:<br>
				  <ul>
					  <li>large numbers of Mayan students who have completed primary school can't read or write in any language</li>
					  <li>discrimination runs rampant through the schools</li>
					  <li>children have low self-confidence, which exacerbates the inequality issues</li>
					  <li>the nature of the Mayan culture may be lost forever</li>
				  </ul></li>
			  <li>Often the family can only afford to have one child go to school. Invariably a boy is chosen for this, so education for girls is even more of an issue.</li>
